### About 8Stash

8Stash is a command-line tool designed to help you quickly save and share your work-in-progress with colleagues or
friends.
Throughout my career as a developer, especially during pair programming sessions, I often needed a fast way to hand over
my current changes when switching drivers. I wanted to automate this process to avoid creating temporary commits or
dealing with patch files, which led to the creation of 8Stash.
This project was also a personal challenge to learn Go by building a practical tool. As the project evolves,
contributions and suggestions to improve its architecture and align it further with Go best practices are highly
encouraged.

The Idea and Goal of this Project is: having a simple command line tool that can quickly stash your current
work-in-progress changes, push them to a remote branch, and share them with others. The tool should be easy to use,
efficient, and integrate seamlessly into a developer's workflow.  
Go was chosen as the language for 8Stash because its simplicity, speed, and portability align perfectly with the
project's goal of creating a reliable and efficient command-line tool for developers.
